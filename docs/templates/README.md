# Templates

This directory contains reusable templates and template examples for documentation.

## What Are Projects?

**Projects** are the core content of the Code and Camera documentation site. Each project is a comprehensive guide, tutorial, or documentation page that teaches visitors how to build, implement, or understand something specific.

### Purpose of Projects

Projects serve multiple purposes:

1. **Educational Content**: Step-by-step tutorials that teach practical skills in Arduino, gardening automation, home lab setup, DevOps automation, and AI/ML
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Document solutions, techniques, and best practices that others can learn from and adapt
3. **Portfolio Showcase**: Demonstrate technical capabilities and hands-on experience with various technologies
4. **Reference Material**: Provide detailed documentation that visitors can return to when implementing similar solutions
5. **Community Building**: Share knowledge openly to help others solve similar problems and learn new skills

### Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and ease of use:

- **Overview**: What the project accomplishes and why it matters
- **Prerequisites**: What you need to know or have before starting
- **Materials**: Hardware, software, and tools required
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: Detailed instructions with code examples
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Next Steps**: Ideas for extending or building upon the project
- **Resources**: Links to additional information and references

### Using the Project Template

The `project-template.md` file in this directory provides a standardized format for creating new projects. Using this template ensures consistency across all project documentation and makes it easier for visitors to navigate and understand the content.

To create a new project:

1. Copy `project-template.md` to the appropriate category folder (arduino, gardening, homelab, automation, or ai)
2. Rename the file to match your project topic
3. Fill in all sections with your project details
4. Set `published: true` in the metadata when ready to publish
5. Add appropriate tags for discoverability
